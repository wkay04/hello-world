# hello-world
My first github project! 

I'm learning version control! I am interested in healthcare policy and honing my data skills in order to effectivey communicate and backup policy prescriptions. 

I live in Omaha, Nebraska but am from Shelburne, Vermont. I miss the mountains but appreciate the low cost of living :)
